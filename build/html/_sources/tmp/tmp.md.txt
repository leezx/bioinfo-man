使用ReadtheDocs托管文档
https://www.xncoding.com/2017/01/22/fullstack/readthedoc.html

优势：
- 速度快
- 可Markdown写作
- GitHub和readthedocs同步

部署：
- error，contents.rst not found
- 创建.readthedocs.yml文件，https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
- 每一个文件必须要有title

比较bookdown：
- 全文搜索做得很烂
- 必须要用rstudio软件
- 过于依赖R
- 目录过于杂乱
- 文献索引做得不错

用法：
- 主要用于创建索引
- 专题正文可以放在cnblog，标题可以放在readthedoc
